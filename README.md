# Plotter
A math Plotter used to calculate the area of a function with different polygonal figures

This is a code project made to facilitate my calculations for a math research.
The research is focused on measuring the efficiency of the hexagon to cover and calculate the area of an irregular shape.
You will need to install the following libraries:  
matplotlib  
numpy  
scipy  
This code was run with python 3.11
