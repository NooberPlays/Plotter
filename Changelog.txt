The most recent code is graph3.py and is actually functioning but there are some modifications to be made:

1.- The "include_touching=True" does not seem to work correctly and counts the same figures.
2.- Figures need to be placed in such a way so that each figure is touching at least 2 vertices from another figure.
3.- Find a way to start the patch placement where I decide to
4.- Change the color of the figures touching and outside the function to red
